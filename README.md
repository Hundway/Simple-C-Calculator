As my first ever github project I've made this console calculator in C to perform simple operations like addition(+),subtraction(-), multiplication(x) and division(/). I'm planning to program some more operations soon and get rid of theneeded space between arguments (numbers and operators).

Just starting with github and programming.
This project was made on an evening.
