As my first ever github project I've made this console calculator in C to perform simple operations like addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(x) and division(/). I'm planning to program some more operations soon.
* No more need for space between arguments, now the program separate each argument to a differente string.

Just starting with github and programming.
This project was made on an evening.
